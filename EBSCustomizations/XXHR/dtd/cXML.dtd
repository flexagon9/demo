<!-- ====
    Common to most variants of the PunchOut transaction set.  Defined here
    to be easily shared between multiple DTD files without requiring
    inclusion of Transaction.mod in all of them.

    All of the PunchOut transaction sets include an originating Request
    (ProviderSetupRequest for example), relatively simple Response
    (PunchOutSetupResponse for example) and final Message
    (ProviderDoneMessage or PunchOutOrderMessage).  The Request and
    Response comprise a back-end transaction between two cooperating
    applications that wish to extend an interactive session from one to the
    other.  The Request provides the destination application with
    authentication, identification and other setup information.  The
    Response provides the originating application with a unique starting
    location for the interactive (HTML) session at the destination system.

    After receiving a Response of this type, the originating application
    redirects the user's browser to the provided location.  (For some
    non-HTML applications, opening a new browser window at that location
    may be more appropriate.)  The destination system eventually provides
    an HTML form to the user's browser.  This form submits the final
    Message to close the remote session, return that user to the
    originating application and carry any required information back to the
    originating application.

    OriginatorCookie - Identification of a specific PunchOut session.  Used

    How the supplier identifies an item they sell.

    If SupplierPartID does not provide a unique key to identify the item,
    then the supplier should generate a key which identifies the part
    uniquely when combined with the SupplierID and SupplierPartID. The
    key is called SupplierPartAuxiliaryID.

    An example is where a Supplier would use the same PartID for an
    item but have a different price for units of "EA" versus "BOX".
    In this case, the ItemIDs should be:
    <ItemID>
        <SupplierPartID>pn12345</SupplierPartID>
        <SupplierPartAuxiliaryID>EA</SupplierPartAuxiliaryID>
    </ItemID>
    <ItemID>
        <SupplierPartID>pn12345</SupplierPartID>
        <SupplierPartAuxiliaryID>
           <foo>well formed XML here</foo>
        </SupplierPartAuxiliaryID>
    </ItemID>
    In this case, the "foo" element must be defined in an internal subset
    sent with the cXML document.  Otherwise, parsers will not be able to
    validate that document.

    In a preferred approach, the sending application may escape the contained
    XML using CDATA sections.  This would appear as:
       ...
       <SupplierPartAuxiliaryID>
           <![CDATA[<foo>well formed XML here</foo>]]>
       </SupplierPartAuxiliaryID>
       ...

    Finally, the angle brackets could be escaped using XML character
    entities.  This might be a bit harder for humans to read.  For example:
       ...
       <SupplierPartAuxiliaryID>
           &lt;foo&gt;well formed XML here&lt;/foo&gt;
